# DnD-battler
A 5e D&amp;D battle simulator written for my own amusement to test some hypotheses.
[An online version of the simulator is hosted in Openshift](battle-matteoferla.rhcloud.com)
I started making a xls of a beastiary, which I was hoping to use to get the presets, which are currently hardcoded, but I have run out of time for now.
